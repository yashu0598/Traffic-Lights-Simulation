# Traffic-Lights-Simulation
Traffic lights simulation,a graphics based C++ project which shows the functionality of traffic lights in peak times and in normal times.
User can dynamically change the traffic lights timings.
In this project, I considered a 4 junction road...and the 4 roads are given with the names North,South,West and East
